• Goals

    MIN weekly calories:            <...>
    Macro caloric ratio (p/f/c):    <...>


• Source

    Attached CSV table "product_data.csv" contains products (hereinafter foods) and all the related nutrition / value info;
    ID column should be used as explicit reference for the foods;


• Output

    Attached document "output_template...." contains the desired output structure; Follow it as such for each of the weeks;


• Rules

    Whilst aiming for accuracy, it's okay for values to diverge slightly (eg. 34/36/30 instead of perfect 35/35/30 ratio);

    Whilst consistency preferred, daily goals can fluctuate, reasonably (as long as weekly goals are met);

    EVERY food and EXCLUSIVELY only from the table shall be used across all the weeks;

    Weeks preferably differ GREATLY, although if first requirement is met, useful foods can be repeated / shared across weeks;

    Individual days shall be UNIQUE, but are fine to share more similarities (expected due to weekly groceries - efficiency).


• Procedure

    Analyze the source;
    Adhere to the goals & rules;
    Synthesize the solution;
    Generate output as laid out;
